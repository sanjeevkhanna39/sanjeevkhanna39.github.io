Boolean constraint satisfaction problems have been studied
from the point of view of decidability, optimization, counting, among
others, and a variety of theorems classifying their complexity
have been obtained. However, almost every such effort developed its own
set of specific tools to obtain the results, thus obscuring many
fundamental
connections between these results and techniques.
The aim of this monograph is to give a unified treatise
of complexity classification results for boolean constraint satisfaction
problems, and to develop a
framework for proving all these results in a uniform way.
Our work covers most of the previously known results and presents many
new
ones, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.
Together, these results shed some light on ``what renders
some problems easy and others hard" in various complexity classes.
